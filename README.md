Small Database and Dashboard Case Study with Olympics Dataset

## Case Study: Historical Analysis of the Olympics (1896-2016)
### Objectives
The main objective of this project is to identify changes within the Olympic Games over time in terms of gender, sports, and participants. It is, therefore, a historical analysis of the Olympic Games. The result is a Tableau dashboard accessible to anyone interested in this information.

### Dataset Description
I got the dataset (olympics_cleaned_v4.csv) from Data Science Institute in Berlin. It contains detailed information on athletes from various sports and countries who have participated in the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. The table includes 219,087 samples and 12 features describing the athletes, including:

ID: Unique identifier for each athlete
Name: Athlete's name
Gender: Athlete's gender (male/female)
Age: Athlete's age during the competition
Height: Athlete's height in cm
Weight: Athlete's weight in kg
NOC: National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the athlete
Year: Year of the Olympic Games
Sport: Sport the athlete participated in
Event: Specific event within the sport
Medal: Type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) or no medal
Country: Athlete's country of origin
The dataset provides a diverse foundation for analyzing success factors across different disciplines and nations.

### Planned Implementation

##### What you cannot see in this repository:
- Initially, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python will be conducted with the raw data (olympics_cleaned_v4.csv) to get a sense of the data and, if necessary, clean it

##### What you can see in this repository:
- A normalized ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) will be created , which will guide the data export into various CSV files. Further, the CSV files will be imported into Tableau to create a dashboard
