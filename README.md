Small Database and Dashboard Case Study with Olympics Dataset

## Case Study: Success Factor Analysis for Olympic Athletes
### Project Description
This project investigates success factors in elite sports using a dataset on Olympic athletes. The aim of the case study is to identify characteristics that can help coaches and sports scientists better prepare athletes for competitions. The analysis seeks to uncover relationships between athletes' demographic and physical attributes, their respective sports, and their success at the Olympic Games.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information on athletes from various sports and countries who have participated in the Olympic Games. The table includes 219,087 entries and 12 attributes describing the athletes, including:

ID: Unique identifier for each athlete
Name: Athlete's name
Gender: Athlete's gender (male/female)
Age: Athlete's age during the competition
Height: Athlete's height in cm
Weight: Athlete's weight in kg
NOC: National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the athlete
Year: Year of the Olympic Games
Sport: Sport the athlete participated in
Event: Specific event within the sport
Medal: Type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) or no medal
Country: Athlete's country of origin
The dataset provides a diverse foundation for analyzing success factors across different disciplines and nations.

### Objectives
The main objective of this project is to analyze relationships between athletes' demographic and physical attributes and their success at the Olympic Games. The results are intended to help coaches and sports scientists better understand which factors—such as age, height, or weight—are particularly relevant in specific disciplines. This information can serve as a foundation for preparing athletes for future competitions.

### Planned Implementation
Initially, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python will be conducted with the raw data to get a sense of the data and, if necessary, clean it. Next, a normalized ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) will be created, which will guide the data export into various CSV files and integration into a database. The CSV files will also be imported into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for coaches and sports scientists.
